        <h2>Welcome to Our Traditional Makdous</h2>
        <p>Makdous is a traditional Lebanese dish made from eggplants. We make this simple dish fresh from tasty ingredients, and it is a healthy and delicious option (not recommended for anyone with nut allergies!). The most important ingredient, other than time, is the level of craftsmanship employed by our makers.</p>
        <p>The truth is that anyone can (and should!) make makdous. It is beloved by all of Lebanon and deserves to be shared with the world. However, for beginners and seasoned makdous lovers alike, we know you’ll find our products have quality you can taste.</p>

        <p>We know makdous is good for you, but don’t take our word for it!</p>
        <p>According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration,makdous contains a plethora of vitamins and minerals that are essential components of a healthy and balanced diet. These include, but are not limited to: calcium, iron, Vitamin A, Vitamin C, essential fatty acids, protein, and a significant amount of fibre.</p>
        <p>We’re not saying that you should eat makdous every day… but you should eat makdous every day.</p>

      <div id="text3">
        <p>One thing we hear again and again is that our containers are significantly smaller than our competitors — and that’s true! You’d be hard-pressed to find a smaller bottle than ours in any store.</p>
        <p>This is for two reasons. Firstly, we care deeply about maximizing the amount of product in our containers. To achieve this efficiently, we lay the stuffed eggplants flat and stack them one on top of another. Our bottles are literally BURSTING with makdous, which is why we can spend less on large packaging, and more on bringing you a quality product.</p>
        <p>The second reason is because we care about our planet, and are looking for ways to reduce the waste our bottles create. Ultimately, our compact approach is good for you, and also good for the environment.</p>

        <p>We care about our customers, the planet, and our product. We take a lot of pride in what we do. Because of this, we farm our own lands to bring you a quality organic product. The walnuts, garlic, sweet red and green peppers, and, of course, eggplants are hand-picked with care, and crafted into our famous, traditional makdous. We work with the best distributors and resellers to get our customers a great product, as quickly and affordably as possible.</p>
        <p>And while you might be able to find similar products in stores, we know you’ll come back to our recipe again and again, because our level of technique is unparalleled in the industry.
